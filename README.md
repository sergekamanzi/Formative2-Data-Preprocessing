# Formative2
# Data Preprocessing 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on preprocessing two real-world datasets to enhance data quality and prepare it for machine learning. The process involved data augmentation, merging datasets using transitive properties, feature engineering and ensuring data consistency.

## Group Members & Contributions
- **Geofrey Tumwesigye**: Part 1 - Data Augmentation on CSV Files
- **Serge Kamanzi**: Part 2 - Merging Datasets with Transitive Properties
- **Willy Kalisa**: Part 3 - Data Consistency and Quality Checks

## How to Use This Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <https://github.com/sergekamanzi/Formative2-Data-Preprocessing>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and run the notebooks in Google Colab.
3. Download and use the preprocessed datasets for training machine learning models.

## Challenges faced
- **Handling Missing Values**: Predictive modeling was required for filling gaps in certain features.
- **Complex Merging**: Transitive mapping added an extra layer of complexity in dataset integration.
- **Feature Engineering**: Required experimentation with different transformations to extract useful insights.
